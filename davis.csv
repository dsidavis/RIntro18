We are moving out of our apartment in the J Street Apartments in early to mid-October (moving to West Sacramento) and are looking for someone to take over our lease. 
The apartment has served us well. It is quite spacious--the bedroom is large, has two closets (one, a walk-in closet and another that goes across an entire wall), a decent kitchen with good counter space, and a spacious living room as well. The bathroom is small (just a little bit larger than a bathroom stall), but everything else is very spacious.
The heater is a wall unit and the air conditioning is a window unit. We regularly use the ceiling fan in the bedroom during the summers because it's difficult for the air conditioning to circulate into the bedroom. There is no dishwasher. The laundry room is right next to the apartment, so doing laundry is really easy. (All laundry is coin-operated, liquid detergent only.)
The complex is great in that it allows dogs and cats. There are no breed or size restrictions on dogs. We were happy to be able to get a dog during our time here. There are plenty of nice lawns and a good number of bag dispensers and garbage cans that make cleaning up after your pet easy. The complex is also fairly close to a large community park on F Street that has a dog park. It also only takes 5 minutes by car to get to Toad Hollow Dog Park on 2nd street from the apartment.
You will have your own parking spot, and there are a good number of guest parking spaces in the lot as well. 
The apartment complex says they provide internet, but the internet service through the complex is actually quite poor. We ended up getting our own service to avoid the hassle of constantly losing internet. Internet is about $35 per month. (Water, sewer and garbage are included in the rent; reliable internet and electricity/gas are not.)
The apartment is on Unitrans route E, so getting to the UC Davis campus and downtown is very easy. Downtown is also about 5 minutes away by car, 8-10 minutes by bike. 
Deposit is $1685. Deposit negotiable under certain circumstances. 
Contact me by text  show contact info
 or by email (I check this less often than texts but will try to be better about it after posting this ad). If you want to see the place we can set up a time for you to see it.
We plan to move out by the second week of October. You would be able to move in by October 17.

Hello my boyfriend and I are renting a house off of anderson road a mile from campus and are looking for someone to rent a room from us. The house is 3bd 2bth with a backyard and garage. We are renting it from the owner and have permission to sublet one room to one person. We have our own master bathroom so you would basically have the living room bathroom to yourself. The room has a closet and is fairly large. 
A little about us. He is returning to school and I am going to be bartending at night and working in tech during the day. We have a medium sized super friendly 3yr old black lab. We live fairly active lifestyles; workout, play sports, hike snowboard, go out for drinks etc. 
Basically we are looking for someone courteous, that cleans up after themselves. A college student or a young professional, like minded or similiar. Were just looking for someone who would make a good roomate and potential friend.  Please text me for details and maybe we can meet up have you look at the place and go from there.
looking forward to meeting you!    ",38.556706,-121.758772,"2018-09-19T13:27:38-0700",NA,"1BR / 1Ba","_apa_d_700-private-room-1-mile-from_6702240304.html",1,1,NA,2018-09-19,"street parking","w/d in unit","house",FALSE

Looking for a new person(s) to take over the lease in my two-bedroom, 1 bath apartment. Each room has separate vanities (a sink and some cabinet space) with a shared toilet/shower. It's on the top floor in the corner of the complex and has been very quiet over the school year and summer. There is a pool, hot-tub, and quarter operated laundry on-site.
This is the apartment complex: http://wakeforestapts.com/. It's the classic Davis lease lasting until end of August 2019. Rent is $1675; there is covered and uncovered parking for additional fee. It is cat friendly. Very, very incredibly close to campus and walkable to Trader Joe's.
Move-in Date ASAP, pending approval from the apt complex rental application. My housemate will be finishing up his time in this apartment and his PhD at the end of the month as well.
Please let me know if interested and/or have any questions!    ",38.549006,-121.762573,"2018-09-20T22:11:27-0700",NA,"2BR / 1.5Ba","_apa_d_apartment-super-close-to-uc_6703432467.html",2,5,NA,2018-09-20,"carport","laundry on site","apartment",FALSE

If you are not happy with the few rental options that are available near UC Davis,   I have discovered a unique lease program that is very attractive for tight rental markets.   You are able to pick any home on the MLS under $550,000 and your only obligation is a 12 month lease.  Go to realtor.com and look around for any home under that price point or email/text me for a list of homes in Davis and Woodland.

This studio apartment has just been entirely remodeled with a new kitchen, bathroom, and living area. It has beautiful new flooring, marble counter tops, and huge windows to let in the natural light. The location is amazing as it is located on A street which runs parallel to the UC Davis quad. It is also right on the edge of downtown so it is less than a 2 minute walk to many popular restaurants such as Burgers and Brew and Crepeville. The unit is a studio so the living area and bedroom are a shared space but it is very spacious so it could be shared by two people. There is laundry and parking on site. The rent is $1675 and this is a year long lease agreement until August 31, 2019. Pictures will be added to this post on Friday the 21st but if you are interested in seeing the unit before then please contact me any time.

1 bedroom/1 bath unit available, just a few blocks from downtown Davis. Downstairs unit with a private patio. Pets are accepted. This is one of the nicer, and well kept pet-friendly complexes in Davis. My unit is unique in that it has a doggie door, which leads to your private patio. Rent is $1330, but if you go directly through The Spoke, this same unit will run you $1425. This unit is in a small courtyard, so there's no noise from street traffic. Management will allow up to three occupants, but I've lived in this apartment alone while attending UCD. 
Facilities:
-3 pools on site
-Business Center
-Fitness Center
-Study Lounge
-Laundry
-Off street parking
This is not a sublet, so you will be signing a new lease that ends on September 1, which is standard practice in this area. I'll be covering the fee to sign over the lease, and you will not need to make a deposit. I have an $1150 deposit on file.
In exchange for forfeiting my deposit, the unit will not be turned over between occupants, but I will make every effort to give you a ""like new"" home. Move-in date may be flexible. Inquire for more information or to set up a viewing.
